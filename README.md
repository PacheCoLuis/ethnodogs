Ethnographic observations analysis code and data on Maya dogs' functional roles

This repository contains a sample of datasets compiled by participants in the project Human and Social Dynamics, Collaborative Research "Development and Resilience of Complex Socioeconomic Systems: A Theoretical Model and Case Study from the Maya Lowlands." (NSF Grant #0827277) conducted in Santa Cruz, Toledo, Belize.

The series of R scripts included here perform the analysis that sustains the results and discussion of the manuscript “An ethnography of dogs in Belize” (short title). Scripts can be run separately, as each one successively runs the previous source.

Make sure to keep Code and Data files in the same folder when running the analysis. Suggestions and edits to firx or improve code and analytical procedures are welcome l.pacheco.cobos@gmail.com or luipacheco@uv.mx
